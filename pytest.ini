# NOTE: this is required to stop pytest from loading conftest.py files
# for our integration tests, as pytest eagerly loads conftests backwards
# we cannot use a hook to ignore them as the integration conftest files
# are loaded before ours, we might be able to fix this by installing
# our own pytest plugin?
